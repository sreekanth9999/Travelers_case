# Travelers_case


This was a classification challenge problem given by Travelers insurance company

The data was of an Australian auto insurance company which asks to clasify which customer which churn their auto insurance next year.
The key measure was to get higher ROC value that cross mark ROC of 67.2

I have ended up getting ROC around 71.5 but unfortunately did not succeed in the competition.
It ended up being a great learning experience.

Please find my jupyter notebook file . I have commented code well

Any further suggestions are welcome.
